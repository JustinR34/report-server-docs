# Search

The search text box is located on top of the search supporting pages. To search for an item, specify all or part of the text that you want to match. The search starts to filter the grid after the second character. Still you can press Enter or the search button to invoke search. The characters in the grid that match the search string are highlighted. The search string is not case-sensitive. You cannot use search operators such as plus (+) or minus (â€“) symbols to require or exclude search criteria. The search is working with exact match.
