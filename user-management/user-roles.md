# User Roles



A *user role* represents a list of same permissions which can be granted to different users. By default there are four built-in user roles after installing the report server:

-   *System Administrator -* the most powerful user role which gives you unrestricted access to all of the report server functionality. The *User Management* view is available only if the user belongs to this user role and this role cannot be deleted.

-   *Report Creator*

    -   All Reports - **unrestricted** access

    -   All Categories - **unrestricted** access

    -   All Data Connections - **Read** access

-   *Report Reader*

    -   All Reports - **Read** access

    -   All Categories - **Read** access

    -   All Data Connections - **Read** access

-   *Data Administrator*

    -   All Reports - **unrestricted** access

    -   All Categories - **unrestricted** access

    -   All Data Connections - **unrestricted** access

You can perform the following actions from the *User roles* view:

-   **Add** new user role

    -   Name

    -   Description

-   **Edit** user role

    -   Name

    -   Description

-   **Delete** user role - you can delete any use role except *System
    Administrator* role

-   **Manage permissions** - permissions management is the same as for
    the user's individual permissions ([Users]({%slug users%}))

-   **Assign users** - you can select/deselect which users belong or not
    to this user role.
