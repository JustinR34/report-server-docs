Invoke the desktop [Report Designer]({%slug report-designer%}) in order to create a new report on the server.

>The Report Designer will be started using the [ClickOnce deployment technology](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t71a733d.aspx "ClickOnce Security and Deployment") which is supported out of the box in the Internet Explorer browser. If you are using another browser you can use a browser extension which adds support for the ClickOnce deployment technology. In case ClickOnce is not supported in your browser, clicking the New report button will bring up a notification containing the Report Designer download link. Use the link to download and start the designer manually.
