# Report Designer

The Report Designer is a report authoring tool. When you design a report, you specify where to get the data, which data to get, and how to display the data. When you run the report, the report processor takes all the information you have specified, retrieves the data, and combines it with the report layout to generate the report. You can preview your reports in Report Designer, or you can publish your report to Report Server, where others can run it.

Report Server supports [SQL]({%slug data-connections-management%}), [Object]({%slug business-objects-management%}), and inline [CSV](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/csvdatasource-component) data sources.

### Report Designer Localization with ClickOnce Deployment

Telerik Report Server supports localization of the Standalone Report Designer when used with ClickOnce deployment.

The **Report Designer -> Options -> Language** drop down lists all available languages (resources) located locally and on the connected Report Servers. If no language is explicitly defined, the Standalone Report Designer will use the language set in the Report Server administration.
