## Description
When the Report Server application is running in 32-bit application pool and opens an ODBC connection that uses a 64-bit driver, ODBC Driver Manager throws either a BadImageFormatException (reproduced with Oracle driver) or shows "The specified DSN contains an architecture mismatch between the driver and the application" error message (reproduced with Progress速 OpenEdge速 driver). The same is valid also if the Report Server is running in 64-bit application pool and ODBC uses a 32-bit driver.

## Solution
If the correct version of database drivers is installed, then the Report Server's application pool should be set to run in different mode (32 or 64-bit). Report Server's application pool settings define it as a 32-bit application by default. To change it, navigate to the Report Server's application pool, open its *Advanced Settings* form and look for a *Enable 32-bit Applications* property. Change it to **False** to run the Report Server instance in 64-bit mode and recycle the pool.
