## Description

As of Telerik Reporting R2 2017, the Report Server and HTML5 Report Viewer require a browser supporting promises.

The error indicates that the used browser does not support promises.
Please follow the [HTML5 Viewer: Important Settings](http://docs.telerik.com/reporting/html5-report-viewer-system-requirements#important-settings) article which contains the requirements for promises.

## Solution

Add a promise polyfill to the page, such as [Polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/).
