# Overview



The Report Server supports [SQL]({%slug data-connections-management%}), [Object]({%slug business-objects-management%}), and inline [CSV](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/csvdatasource-component) data sources.

SQL data connections can be managed from the [Data Connections View]({%slug data-connections-management%}).

For business objects data management refer to [Business Objects Management]({%slug business-objects-management%}).

CSV data can be created and managed directly from the report designer.
