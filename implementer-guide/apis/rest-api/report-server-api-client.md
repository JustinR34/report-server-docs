# Report Server API Client

The Report Server API client is a .NET library which comes in handy when developing .NET applications which would connect to the [Report Server API]({%slug rest-api-reference%}).
The client provides access to the available API endpoints. To gain access to the client and its methods it is required to add the following assembly references:

1. Telerik.ReportServer.HttpClient.dll
2. Telerik.ReportServer.Services.Models.dll

The assemblies can be found in the Report Server installation folder under **\Tools**. The folder also contains XML files with corresponding names which provide IntelliSense support for Visual Studio.

How to use the client to interact with the Report Server is demonstrated in [Report Server API Client Examples]({%slug report-server-api-client-examples%}).
