# Reports Management



In the **Reports** view you can manage the reports which reside on the server.

The Reports view provides the following functions:

  - _Upload a report_ – this is the way the reports are uploaded to the server. When uploading a report you should select the XML report file definition (a .trdx file), specify the report's __title__ and select the report's __category__. All the fields are mandatory except the __description__.  

  >To upload a report you need to create at least one category.
  - _Upload a revision_ – A report revision is an edited version of the original report. If you have modified the original report and want to replace it on the server, then upload it as a revision._
  - _Edit report properties_ – You can change the __title__, __description__ and the __category__ of the uploaded report at any time.
  - _Preview report_ – You can preview the report in the HTML5 report viewer and export the report to various formats from it.
  - _Copy report_ – Use this functionality to create a copy of the original report.
  - _Delete report_ – If you no longer need a specific report you can delete it from the server.
  - _Favorite report_ – You can mark a report as favorite for easier access to it.

When a report has been selected you can see on the right side of the grid a details view. The details view shows additional information about the report as well as the report's history.
